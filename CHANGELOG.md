## [Unreleased]

## [0.15.0]

### Added
- Add support creating branches from existing sources via the `github_branch` resource
- `etag` added as ignored change on the `github_repository` lifecycle

### Removed

- Burnt in test accounts ("terraform-test-user", "terraform-test-user-1") to make test runnable on organisations without them

### Fixed

## [0.14.0]

### Added

- Add support for `require_conversation_resolution` for Branch Protection (thanks to @0x46616c6b)
- Add support for `encrypted_secrets`

### Changed

- BREAKING: update to provider `~> 4.20` fixing an issue that was just supporting `v4.19.x`

## [0.13.0]

### Added

- Add GitHub Autolink References configuration block (thanks to @0x46616c6b)

## [0.12.0]

### BREAKING CHANGES

Bumped the minimum supported version of the GitHub Terraform Provider to `v4.19.2`
since it contains a critical bugfix to support `required_approving_review_count = 0`
on branch protection rules. Also, `allow_auto_merge` has been added in `v4.17.0`.

### Added

- Add support for `allow_auto_merge`

## [0.11.0]

### BREAKING CHANGES

We dropped support for Terraform pre 1.0 and GitHub Terraform Provider pre 4.0.
In addition we changed to the `integrations/github` official GitHub Terraform Provider.
This needs migration actions if you already used this module with the `hashicorp/github` provider and want to upgrade.

#### Migration from previous versions

To migrate from a previous version, please ensure that you are using the
`integrations/github` official GitHub Terraform Provider.


``` hcl
terraform {
  required_version = "~> 1.0"

  required_providers {
    github = {
      source  = "integrations/github"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Once you've updated the provider, a manual state migration is required to
migrate existing resources to the new provider.
The following command will replace the provider in the state.

``` bash
terraform state replace-provider registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/github registry.terraform.io/integrations/github
```

After you've migrated the state, please run
`terraform init` to apply the changes to the resources.

### Added

- Add support for Official GitHub Terraform Provider `integrations/github`

### Removed

- Removed support for Terraform < 1.0
- Removed support for GitHub Provider < 4.0
- Removed compatibility to Hashicorp GitHub Terraform Provider `hashicorp/github`

### Fixed

- Set `webhooks` output as sensitive.
- Add underscores in team names (special thanks to @marc-sensenich)
- Fix `dismiss_stale_reviews` in README to a default value of `true`

## [0.10.1]

### Fixed

- Set `vulnerability_alerts` per default to `true` for public repositories and
  to `false` for private repositories if not explicitly set to avoid drifts
  when running `terraform plan`.

## [0.10.0]

### Added

- Add support for Terraform `v1.0`

## [0.9.2]

### Fixed

- Fix terraform typing issue when defining branch protections for multiple branches

## [0.9.1]

### Added

- Add support for GitHub Pages configuration in repositories

## [0.9.0]

### Added

- Add support for Terraform `v0.15`

## [0.8.0]

**_This is a BREAKING RELEASE._**

Branch protection resourcess will be recreated and new fetures are added enforcing security by default.

Please review plans and report regressions and issues asap so we can improve documentation for upgrading.

### Upgrade path/notes:

- Branch protections will be recreated in a compatible way. Alternatively, all branch protections could be manually updated using `terraform state mv` but this is not recommended as it is a manual process that can suffer from human prone errors.
- If you do not want to archive repositories on deletion set `archive_on_destroy` to false in repository configurations.

#### Expected differences in a plan after upgrading:

- Addition to `module.<NAME>.github_repository.repository`:
  - Addition or changed default of argument `archive_on_destroy = true`
- Destruction of `module.<NAME>.github_branch_protection.branch_protection[*]`
- Creation of `module.<NAME>.github_branch_protection_v3.branch_protection[*]`
- Replacement of `module.<NAME>.github_team_repository.team_repository_by_slug[<SLUG>]`
  - Triggered by change in `team_id = "<NUMBER>" -> "<SLUG>"`

### Added

- Add support for Github Provider v4 (Minimal compatible version is v4.5).
- Add support for `archive_on_destroy` repository flag defaulting to `true`.
- Add support for `vulnerability_alerts` repository flag.
- Add security deny list for v4.7.0, v4.8.0, v4.9.0 and v4.9.1 due to a bug setting visibility to public for templated repository creation.

### Changed

- Use [`github_branch_protection_v3`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest/docs/resources/branch_protection_v3) instead of [`github_branch_protection`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/integrations/github/latest/docs/resources/branch_protection) for performance and compatibility reasons. **ATTENTION**: This Change will trigger recreation of all branch protections when upgrading to v0.8.0.
- Use `github_branch_default` to set default branch of repositories. **ATTENTION**: This Change will trigger creation of new resource when `default_branch` argument is set.

### Removed

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed support for Github Provider before v4.3

## [0.7.0]

### Added

- Add support for `visibility` parameter. Defaults to `private` and respects desired state as defined in deprecated `private` parameter.
